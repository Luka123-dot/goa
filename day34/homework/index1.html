                <p>Hi guys and welcome back to my blog.</p>
                <p>I woke up at 8:30 A.M today.</p>
                <p>I ate honey cheerios for breakfast and then washed the dishes.</p>
                <p>After my breakfast, I went out for a little run since it was sunny out.</p>
                <p>After I got back, I cooked up some scrambled eggs and steak.</p>
                <p>When I finished eating, it was already 11 A.M</p>
                <p>Me and the boys decided to go out and play soccer on a public pitch.</p>
                <p>I forgot my cleats so I played in my crocs,sport mode of course.</p>
                <p>When we finished playing we decided to go out to mcdonalds.</p>
                <p>After mcdonalds we all went home because it was around 4 P.M</p>
                <p>I continued running on the treadmail on my house.</p>
                <p>I ran for around 1 hour and I hopped on call of duty at 5:30 P.M</p>
                <p>We played cod and fortnite for 5-6 hours and then I went to sleep.</p>
